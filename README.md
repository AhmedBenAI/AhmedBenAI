## 🚀 Featured Work  

🔹 **Flask-Based Object Detection Web Application (Dockerized)**  
Designed and deployed a fully containerized **object detection web platform** using **Flask** and **Docker Compose**.  
The system performs image uploads, inference through a pre-trained **YOLO-based model**, and displays bounding boxes with confidence metrics in real time.  
Metrics such as detection counts, per-class averages, and inference speed are automatically computed and visualized through an integrated dashboard.  
This project demonstrates strong experience in **model deployment**, **REST API design**, and **Docker-based orchestration**.

🔹 **Drone-Based Computer Vision for Forensic Analysis**  
Developed a custom-trained **YOLOv8-L model** on over **6,000 aerial drone images** for real-time human detection and scene analysis.  
The system runs inference at ~20 FPS on RTX 3060 hardware and supports **live RTMP video streaming**, enabling on-the-fly detection for forensic and safety use cases.  
This project highlights advanced knowledge in **computer vision**, **dataset curation**, and **edge AI performance optimization**.

🔹 **Automated Dashboard Generation using Machine Learning**  
Created as part of my MSc research at **USTOMB**, this project automates the generation of dashboards by analyzing dataset characteristics and recommending suitable chart types.  
The backend, developed with **Flask-AppBuilder**, uses **feature importance** and **data preprocessing** techniques to select the most relevant visualizations dynamically.  
It represents a practical application of **machine learning in data analytics automation**.

🔹 **Custom Apache Superset Integration with Keycloak**  
Extended **Apache Superset** by developing custom API endpoints to integrate **Keycloak** authentication and manage user roles.  
This enhancement allows seamless login experiences, consistent role-based access control, and secure cookie management across multiple internal web applications.  
The solution bridges the gap between **enterprise-level security** and **data visualization flexibility**.
