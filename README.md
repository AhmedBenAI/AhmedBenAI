## Featured Work

### End-to-End Wildlife Object Detection System  
**Model Training → Deployment → Production API**

Designed and implemented a complete machine learning pipeline for wildlife object detection.

- Trained object detection models using TensorFlow 2  
- Optimized inference for real-world usage  
- Deployed models behind a backend API  
- Containerized the system using Docker for production readiness  

**Repositories:**  
- `wildlife-object-detection-tf2` — model training and experimentation  
- `wildlife-object-detection-api` — production API and deployment

### Drone Human Risk Detection  
**Applied Computer Vision | Safety-Critical Contexts**

Built a computer vision system to detect humans and assess risk in drone imagery.

- Object detection in aerial environments  
- Focus on real-world constraints and deployment considerations  

---

### Automated Dashboard Generation using Machine Learning  
**MSc Research Project | Data Analytics Automation**

Developed a system that automatically generates dashboards by analyzing dataset characteristics and recommending appropriate visualization types.

- Feature importance analysis and data preprocessing  
- Flask-AppBuilder backend  
- Integrated with Apache Superset  

---

### Enterprise Apache Superset Integration with Keycloak  
**Backend, Security & Platform Engineering**

Extended Apache Superset by developing custom API endpoints to integrate Keycloak authentication and centralized role management.

- Seamless authentication across multiple internal applications  
- Consistent role-based access control  
- Secure cookie and session handling
